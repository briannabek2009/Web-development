      <!-- Challenge 5: Write a paragraph describing web development.  Discuss the purpose of HTML, CSS and JavaScript -->
  <p> Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that are accessible on the internet.
     It involves various technologies, among which HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fundamental. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 
     serves as the backbone of a webpage, providing its structure and content such as text, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
      is used to style and layout the webpage, controlling visual aspects like colors, fonts, and spacing to make the site aesthetically
       appealing. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality, enabling features like form validation, animations, and 
       real-time updates. Together, these technologies work harmoniously to build modern, engaging, and user-friendly websites.</p>
